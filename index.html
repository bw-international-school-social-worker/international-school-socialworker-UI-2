      <h2>What it does</h2>
    
      <p>We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>

        <h3>How can we improve the world?</h3>
    
        <p>I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Let's make a happy little mountain now. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.</p>

        <p>Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. There we go. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.</p>
